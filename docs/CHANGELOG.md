# Changelog

Newest first. Every entry names the weights it applies to; the Hub repositories keep earlier weights under tags where noted.
`HISTORY.md` is the long form: how each stage was trained and what was measured.

## Team fork — unreleased

Code-only changes for `omgwowai/decider`; published model weights are unchanged.

- Add an isolated NVIDIA deployment launcher for the scaffold submodule. Install this checkout, pin the default 0.8B checkpoint revision, verify CUDA execution, and expose the official System One API on loopback port 8102.
- Keep model construction, graph warmup, synchronization and scoring on one GPU owner thread; report CUDA readiness only after startup completes.
- Bound pending requests before tokenization and preserve reservations until accepted work settles, including disconnected clients and failed batches.
- Reject oversized state input in the scaffold deployment rather than silently truncating it.
- Add optional exact `fixed_length` padding to the library Engine/Decider, rejecting oversized prepared rows without changing default bucketed inference.

## 1.2.1 (2026-09-23): jinja2 is a dependency

Code only; no weights change. The chat layout of 1.2.0 builds its prompts with the tokenizer's chat template
(`tok.apply_chat_template`), which needs `jinja2`; transformers does not install it. 1.2.0 did not list it, so loading a
chat-layout model in an environment without `jinja2` stopped with an `ImportError`. No released model uses the chat
layout, so no released model was affected. `jinja2` is now a dependency of the package, and the test workflow installs it.

## 1.2.0 (2026-09-23): the chat prompt layout

Code only; no weights change: `Mapika/decider-2b` stays v10. decider-2b v11, a research checkpoint that is not released, was
trained with every prompt wrapped in its tokenizer's chat template, and it gives wrong probabilities when it is read in the
plain layout that every released model uses. 1.2.0 reads
the layout from the model's `decider_config.json`. `"layout": "chat"` (or `"chat_template": true`) selects the chat
layout. A config with no `"layout"` key selects the plain layout, which is every released model up to and including
decider-2b v10, decider-4b, decider-35b-a3b, decider-0.8b and decider-2b-vision.

The chat layout, state-first, for Qwen3.5:

    <|im_start|>user\n  Context:\n<state>  \n\nQuestion: <q>\nOptions:\n(A) ..\n(B) ..  <|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n\n</think>\n\n  Answer: (

The head and tail of the template come from `tok.apply_chat_template` on a single user turn, with no system prompt and with
thinking switched off (`enable_thinking=False`). When a row holds several questions, all question blocks come first. The
answer pieces (`Answer 1: (`, `\nAnswer 2: (`, ...) follow the tail. In the schema-first layout the user turn holds the
question blocks and then `\n\nContext:\n<state>`. Each part is tokenized separately, and the letter is read at the final
` (` token, as in the plain layout. The state cap (`max_ctx_tokens`, `DECIDER_MAX_STATE_TOKENS`) applies to
`Context:\n<state>`; the template tokens do not count against it (3 head tokens and 9 tail tokens for Qwen3.5).

Every path that builds prompts uses the layout: `decider.infer.Decider` (`decide`, `decide_batch`, `decide_json`,
`system_one`, `schema()`), on CUDA with graphs and on MPS and CPU; `decider.serve` (`/decide`, `/v1/systemone`, the
shared-prefix fork, the schema cache); and `decider.bench.eager_reference`. `decider.prompt` has the new functions
`resolve_layout`, `chat_template`, `chat_for` and `build_chat`. `build`, `schema_prefix_ids`, `schema_suffix_ids`,
`prompt_fast.build_rows`, `serve.prepare` and `SchemaEngine` take an optional `chat=` argument. The default `None` is the
plain layout. The engines are unchanged: they score token ids and do not depend on the layout. `/health` and the start-up
line of the server report the layout. A config that names a layout this version does not know (anything except `"plain"` and
`"chat"`), or that says both `"layout": "plain"` and `"chat_template": true`, raises a `ValueError` that names the value.
`Decider` raises it before loading the weights and the server raises it at start-up. `decider.serve_v1`, the 1.0.x server,
renders only the plain layout, and it now refuses a chat-layout model at start-up. Versions 1.1.x and earlier do not read
the `layout` key, so they read a chat-layout model in the plain layout without an error. A chat-layout model needs 1.2.0
or later.

Checks:

- **Plain layout.** Token ids are identical to 1.1.3/1.1.4. `tests/test_layout.py` pins sha256 digests of 359 prompt sets
  produced by 1.1.3: `prompt.build` (state-first and schema-first, several state caps, shuffled and unshuffled),
  `schema_prefix_ids`, `schema_suffix_ids`, `build_rows`, `serve.prepare`, the `/decide` preparation, and the prompt
  building of `Decider.decide_batch` and `Decider.system_one` with `neutralize_none` and `isolated_levels` on and off. On
  a GPU, decider-2b v10 under 1.1.3 and under 1.2.0 gives identical answers on 121 Decision Index rows (`system_one`),
  identical `decide_json` answers, and identical raw `decide_batch` probabilities (maximum absolute difference 0.0).
- **Chat layout, token ids.** The ids equal those of the chat-layout research server that v11 was evaluated with, and those
  of the builder v11 was trained with. The tests hold copies of both renderers. Against the originals, with the v11
  tokenizer: 802 `/v1/systemone` requests (401 Decision Index rows plus a 40,000-event log state with a 200-option
  question, each at state caps 32,768 and 512; 7,468 rows, of which 624 are truncated and 150 have more than 10 options;
  packed rows as well); 200 `/decide` requests; and 2,700 training-builder items (1,350 state-first and 1,350
  schema-first, with random option order, sub-sampling from 300 options, and state caps of 64, 1,536 and 16,384 tokens).
  All are equal.
- **Chat layout, probabilities** (decider-2b v11 candidate, T 1.0257, GPU, 301 Decision Index rows, 2,848 questions,
  compared with the research server's engine). The package's `Engine` with the server's settings (compile off, conv patch
  off) gives identical probabilities (maximum absolute difference 0.0, no argmax changes). The HTTP server (`EngineV2`,
  answers rounded to 4 decimals) gives a mean per-question maximum difference of 0.00027 and a maximum of 0.026, with 1
  argmax change. The library `Decider` (`torch.compile` and conv patch on, which is the library default for every model)
  gives a mean of 0.0044 and a maximum of 0.040, with 16 argmax changes, all at a top-2 margin of 0.06 or less. For
  comparison, the difference between the two engines on decider-2b v10 in the plain layout is a mean of 0.0028 and a
  maximum of 0.069, with 7 argmax changes. On CPU (the eager path that MPS also uses), 12 rows with 19 questions have
  equal ids, a maximum difference of 0.014 and no argmax changes.
- **Regression readout** (95-task public regression set, 144,226 rows, per-task RNG 1234, state cap 1,536, state-first,
  temperature fitted on the 67 in-task tasks). The package builds the rows with `prompt.build(..., chat=...)`. Through
  the eager model path, the probabilities are identical to the research readout of the v11 candidate on every row
  (maximum difference 0.0). The fitted temperature is 1.0257, and held-out accuracy, NLL and ECE (Decision Index
  definition) are 0.7619, 0.6161 and 0.0501, the same as the research readout. Through the library's CUDA-graph engine
  (compiled), the mean per-row maximum difference is 0.0035, 748 of 144,226 argmaxes change, and the held-out numbers
  are 0.7607, 0.6162 and 0.0512.
- **Evaluation, probes and benchmarks.** `decider.evaluate` (`run_eval(..., chat=)` and its CLI), `decider.probes.isolated`,
  `decider.probes.independence`, `decider.bench.verify_engine_v2`, `decider.bench.schema`, `decider.bench.latency` and the
  `decider.engine` self-check and `moe/vllm_check.py` read the model's layout (`decider.prompt.chat_for_model`, which reads `decider_config.json`
  from a folder or a Hub id) and build chat prompts for a chat model. `decider.serve_v1` reads the config the same way,
  so it also refuses a chat model given as a Hub id. The training and data-building code (`decider.train`,
  `decider/data/`, `decider.games.rl`, `decider.vision`) renders the plain layout only.
- **cuDNN attention off on the eager path too.** Since 1.0.2 the CUDA-graph engines switch off PyTorch's cuDNN
  scaled-dot-product-attention backend, which returns wrong output for masked attention on Blackwell with torch 2.14.
  `DecisionModel`, which `Decider(..., use_graphs=False)`, `decider.evaluate` and the probes use, now switches it off
  as well. The setting is process-wide, as it already was once an engine was built.

## 1.1.4 (2026-09-23): decider-35b-a3b on Apple Silicon, two MPS replacements

Code only; no weights change. Contributed by @nassersala in issue #6. On MPS, decider-35b-a3b ran transformers' Qwen3.5-MoE
reference code, and two operations in it took most of each decision on an M5 Max: `torch.histc` (tokens per expert, about
45 ms a call, once per MoE layer) and `torch.linalg.solve_triangular` (about 17 ms a call, twice per linear-attention layer).
The library's MPS patch (`decider.mps_ops.patch_mps`), which until now covered only the dense Qwen3.5 module, also installs
`decider/mps_moe.py`: an exact count in place of `histc`, and a block-doubling inverse in place of the unit lower-triangular
solve. They are installed only into the two transformers modules that make these calls (`transformers.integrations.moe`
and `modeling_qwen3_5_moe`, each given its own view of `torch`); global `torch` and every other caller are untouched, and
inside those modules they act only on MPS tensors of the matching call shape. The count drops out-of-range expert ids as
`histc` does. Reported effect: 2.8-4 s a decision becomes 0.23-0.5 s for typical inputs and 2.5 s for a 3,900-token input
(was 11 s); the JevBench public-item counts are unchanged (48/48, 70/72, 75/111). `DECIDER_MPS_MOE_PATCH=0` before the first
`patch_mps()` call leaves them out. Tested here on CPU tensors (the count equals `histc` including dropped ids; the solve matches torch to 1e-10
in float64). Tested on MPS by @nassersala at commit ac3183d (M5 Max, 128 GB, torch 2.14.0, transformers 5.17.0), JevBench
public items, 231 items:

| | easy / standard / hard | same answer as before, items | seconds a decision, median / p90 |
|---|---|---|---|
| decider-35b-a3b, 1.1.4 | 48/48, 70/72, 75/111 | 231 of 231 | 0.33 / 2.2 |
| decider-35b-a3b, `DECIDER_MPS_MOE_PATCH=0` | 48/48, 70/72, 75/111 | 231 of 231 | 3.16 / 7.8 |
| decider-2b, 1.1.4 (dense model; replacements not used) | 48/48, 63/72, 51/111 | 231 of 231 | 0.05 / 0.35 |

With the replacements the 35B's probabilities move by a median of 0.002 (largest 0.29, on a 2,338-token item); rerun with the
solve done exactly on CPU in float64, the block inverse was closer to the exact result than the MPS solver on 3 of the 4
most-shifted items. The 35B card now lists the Mac result.

## 1.1.3 (2026-09-23): `/decide` answers a malformed schema with 422

Code only; no weights change. Reported in issue #8: `POST /decide` with no `schema`, or with a question mapped straight to a
list of options (`{"Which team?": ["billing", "technical"]}`), returned 500 with an unhandled traceback, because the request
model accepted `None` and any dict and the first code to look inside the schema was the question conversion. The schema is
now checked before any work (`decider.infer.Decider._check_schema`). A missing schema, a schema that is not an object (one
holding NaN or Infinity was a 500, because the validation error echoed it), a field that is not an object, choice
options that are not a non-empty list of strings, a scale legend that is empty, has keys that are not finite numbers or holds
NaN or Infinity, and an unknown type are 422s whose message names the expected form. Legends with non-finite keys or values
were also a 500 (the answer could not be serialised), and so were non-string options under the default settings. Every
other schema 1.1.2 answered is still answered the same way, with two exceptions: options or a legend given as a bare string,
which 1.1.2 split into single characters, and non-string options on a model whose `decider_config.json` sets `neutralize_none` to false, are now 422s. An empty
schema returns `{}` without a forward pass. The library's `decide_json` raises the same `ValueError`. `/v1/systemone` with an
empty question map still returns 200 with an empty answer map, as in 1.0.x.

## 1.1.2 (2026-09-22): the HTTP server runs on MPS and CPU

Code only; no weights change. Reported in issue #5: the server always built its engine on `cuda`, so on a machine without CUDA
it stopped at start-up with torch's "Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled" assertion, while the README lists MPS and CPU. The
server now picks its device the way `decider.infer.Decider` does (CUDA, else MPS, else CPU; float16 on MPS, bfloat16
elsewhere), and `DECIDER_DEVICE=auto|cuda|cuda:<i>|mps|cpu` overrides it. Off CUDA there are no graphs to capture, so start-up
skips the warm-up and every request runs eager; on MPS the engine applies the same MPS patch as the library. An explicit
device that is not available, or `DECIDER_FP8` / `DECIDER_COMPILE` off CUDA, stops start-up with a message naming the
requirement. `/health` reports the device. Checked on CPU with no GPU visible: the server answers the README example with the
same probabilities as `Decider(device="cpu")` (billing 0.5706, refund 0.987, frustration 0.354 / 0.540 / 0.106), 685 ms per
request. MPS is not tested here; it uses the code path of the merged Apple Silicon work. Nothing changes on CUDA.

## 1.1.1 (2026-09-22): cross-request batch merging and a bounded shared-prefix fork

Code only; no weights change. Same routes, same request and response format, same limits. Two changes to `decider.serve`
and the two engines, both measured on decider-2b. Design and measurements: `docs/SERVING.md`, section 4.

**Batching.** 1.1.0 grouped the rows a collection pulled off the queue by exact padded length, so two requests that
arrived together but landed in different length buckets ran as separate forwards; at concurrency 8 that was 2,238 batches
for 2,000 requests, 1,250 of them a single row. `decider/batching.py` replaces the grouping with a partition that pads a
shorter row into a longer row's bucket when that costs less than a second forward. A forward of `B` rows at padded length
`T` is modelled as `DECIDER_MERGE_OVERHEAD_TOKENS + B * T` token-units; rows are sorted by padded length descending and a
dynamic program takes the cheapest split into consecutive groups, each capped at the engine's widest captured batch
bucket for its length and at `DECIDER_MAX_BATCH`. Rows above the last captured length bucket still run alone in their own
padded length. The 1.1.0 grouping is one of the partitions the program may choose, so the planned cost is never above it.
`DECIDER_MERGE_OVERHEAD_TOKENS` defaults to 512: on the 2B a single-row forward fits `t(T) = 9.20 ms + 13.80 us/token`
over the bucket ladder, so the fixed cost is worth 667 tokens, and 512 is the nearest power of two.
`DECIDER_BATCH_ADAPTIVE_WAIT_MS` (2 ms) is a new collection window that applies only after a collection that held live
rows from more than one request, and only while the queue stays busy: a first row that took more than 50 ms to arrive
drops the window again, and rows whose request has already gone away are not counted. After a single-request collection
the batcher does not wait, as before.

**Shared prefix.** `Engine.score_shared` and `EngineV2.score_shared` ran the state once and then
`cache.reorder_cache(zeros(n))`, which copies the prefix cache to all `n` question rows at once: `n` times the prefix
cache, which is 133 GB for a 31k-token state with 32 questions on a 31B model. The implementation now lives in
`decider/shared_prefix.py`, used by both engines, and forks the prefix cache in chunks of `m` rows with
`m = clamp(DECIDER_SHARED_FORK_GB // prefix_bytes, 1, n)`, the budget also capped at half the memory free on the device.
`min_prefix`, the cuDNN SDPA policy and `Engine.score_shared`'s signature are unchanged. The fork helpers walk
`cache.layers` and handle `keys`, `values`, `indexer_keys`, `conv_states` and `recurrent_states` without assuming one
layout, and always allocate fresh tensors, because the linear-attention layers write their states back in place. A layer
holding a tensor under any other name is not chunked at all: `score_shared` falls back to the 1.1.0 single fork of every
row and counts it in `/stats -> engine.shared_unchunked_layout`, which stays at zero on the released checkpoints. Answers: with equal-length suffixes the chunked path is bit-identical to the single fork at every chunk size, so
the batch size on its own changes nothing; with suffixes of different lengths a chunk pads to its own longest suffix and
the answers move by at most 2.9e-5 (four rows, 223 to 450-token suffixes) to 1.5e-2 (32 rows, 182 to 932-token suffixes)
of probability, argmax unchanged. Peak reserved memory on the 2B for the heaviest shared-prefix request in the 4,000-row
Decision Index sample (17 questions over a 7,988-token state): 3.75 GB before, 1.94 GB at a 1 GB budget, 0.67 GB at one
row per fork. On a synthetic 16,000-token state with 32 questions, 15.38 GB before and 2.17 GB at a 1 GB budget. The
default 8 GB budget does not bind on anything in that sample; it bounds the long-state case.

**Measured** (1,000 Decision Index rows, decider-2b, one B300 shared with a training run, so the absolute latencies are
inflated; 1.1.0 from the released checkout, 1.1.1 from the working tree, back to back on the same card): at concurrency 1
the median is unchanged at 18.5 ms, p99 379 against 401 ms, throughput 17.30 against 17.25 req/s. At concurrency 8 the
server runs 748 batches for 1,000 requests instead of 1,027 (single-row batches 210 against 476), throughput 19.02
against 18.46 req/s, median 301 against 304 ms, mean 420 against 433 ms, p99 1,300 against 1,316 ms. No errors in any
run. Two controls on the new code: with `DECIDER_MERGE_OVERHEAD_TOKENS=0` the batching is the 1.1.0 grouping again (1,207
and 1,017 batches) and the gain disappears; with `DECIDER_BATCH_ADAPTIVE_WAIT_MS=0` nothing measurable changes. Agreement
with the masked eager forward is unchanged: 8 to 13 of 8,247 answers differ in argmax in every case, old and new, one
answer above a 0.05 probability tolerance, `usage` identical.

## decider-4b v1 (2026-09-22): the supervised recipe on Qwen3.5-4B-Base with mixture v2

[Mapika/decider-4b](https://huggingface.co/Mapika/decider-4b) (bf16, 8.4 GB). One supervised pass over mixture v2, 742M tokens: the
public decision mixture (60% of tokens) plus 26 further public decision datasets (code, logs, legal, tables, finance, medical,
science, multilingual, temporal and rule reasoning) and ten programmatic families with verifiable gold, each with a held-out
variant. `torch.optim.AdamW` on the bf16 parameters, no FP32 master copy (the public trainer's optimizer), peak LR 1e-5, cosine, 26,729
steps of 32,768 tokens, 577 minutes on two B300s. No RL stage. Temperature 1.05 fitted on the in-task half of the regression set.
Against decider-2b v10 on the same rows: accuracy higher on 87 of 95 regression tasks (in-task / held-out 0.834 / 0.788 against
0.805 / 0.755, NLL −0.07), +2.7 points on the validation rows, +5.7 on Mind2Web, +0.6 on OpenJev, level on TypeSafe, JevBench hard
tier 0.541 against 0.459, Bespoke's suite 0.757 against 0.704 macro; below decider-35b-a3b by 2.1 to 2.3 regression points and on
every fixture. Live browser: greedy play level with v10 over all tasks (91.5% against 90.9%) and 17 points below it on the six
tasks v10 never used for reward (75.0% against 91.7%); sampled play 90.9% against 93.2%. Zero-shot on the ten text games (no game
rows in mixture v2): CliffWalking and Blackjack at teacher level, Breakout 18 against the teacher's 22, Pong not learned. Decision
Index 4,000-request sample: index 48.5 (2B 42.3, 35B 50.4), calibration error 0.086 against the 2B's 0.093 and the 35B's 0.027;
the 4B is overconfident outside its regression set (JevBench hard-tier ECE 0.29). Tables in `docs/RESULTS.md`, the model card on the Hub.

## 1.1.0 (2026-09-22): the HTTP server captures its CUDA graphs at start-up

Code only; no weights change. `decider.serve` is a new implementation with the same module name, routes, request format and
response format (fields, order, `usage`, 422 bodies); the environment variables are the same except where listed below. The
1.0.x server is kept for one release as `decider.serve_v1` (its code unchanged, its module docstring replaced) and is removed in
1.2.0. Probabilities are not byte-identical across the two servers: the defaults changed from FP8 to bf16 and a Hub-id
configuration is now read (below). Design, limits and measurements: `docs/SERVING.md`.

What changed and why. On the Decision Index the 1.0.x server gave decider-2b a p95 of 1,641 ms against a 50 ms median. The
cause was shape-dependence: the graph grid stopped at 2,048 tokens and was only warmed to 1,536, so the first request at a new
`(batch, length)` shape paid a torch.compile and a graph capture with the GPU lock held, and rows above 2,048 tokens ran eager
at request-specific shapes. The new server:

* captures every CUDA graph of a fixed `(batch bucket, length bucket)` grid during start-up (lengths 64 to 8,192, batches 1 to
  32, 89 graphs) and then seals the engine: on the default path no request can trigger a capture or a compile. Rows above
  8,192 tokens run eager in bounded chunks. The opt-in schema cache is the exception: as in 1.0.x, the first request with a new
  schema runs its prefix and captures one graph per (schema, batch bucket, state bucket); `/stats -> schema_cache` counts them.
  Engine: `decider.engine_v2.EngineV2`.
* defaults to `DECIDER_COMPILE=0` and `DECIDER_FP8=0` (were 1). At the old defaults the served probabilities differ from the
  bf16 weights on 1.3% to 2.8% of the measured answers (the 1.0.x row of the `docs/SERVING.md` table); the new defaults serve the
  bf16 numerics. The two switches were not measured in isolation against the new server; both remain available.
* keeps the shared-state path on (`DECIDER_SHARED=1`): an independent request with several questions over a state of at least
  768 tokens runs the state once and forks the cache per question. It is correct because the engine applies the attention
  backend policy of 1.0.2 before any capture; `tests/test_engine_v2_cuda.py` checks it against the full forward on the shape
  that failed.
* runs every forward on one GPU thread, tokenises the state once per request instead of once per question, and groups rows
  waiting at the same moment by length bucket.
* bounds requests before they reach the GPU: HTTP 413 when a request expands to more than `DECIDER_MAX_ROWS` (1,024) scoring
  rows, when a row exceeds `DECIDER_MAX_ROW_TOKENS` (state cap + 4,096 = 36,864) tokens, or when the request exceeds
  `DECIDER_MAX_REQUEST_TOKENS` (1,048,576) tokens in total; HTTP 503 when more than `DECIDER_MAX_QUEUE_ROWS` (4,096) rows are
  admitted and not yet scored. 1.0.x had no such limits.
* reads `decider_config.json` from a Hub id as well as from a folder. 1.0.x only read it from a folder, so
  `scripts/serve.sh Mapika/decider-2b` served temperature 1.0 with isolated levels off and the model name `decider-dev`; it now
  serves the config's temperature 1.3, isolated levels and `decider-v10`, as the library does.
* `/decide` returns 422 with the message for an invalid schema (1.0.x returned 500).
* `/health` is true only once the graphs are captured and the batcher is running; `/stats` adds `rows`, `rejected_too_large`,
  `rejected_overloaded`, `outstanding_rows`, `limits`, `schema_cache` and the engine's capture/replay/eager counters
  (`graph_captures`, `replays`, `eager_forwards`, `shared_calls` replace the 1.0.x `long_forwards` and `shared_prefix_calls`).
  `errors` counts requests that failed after parsing (question validation, inference failures); Pydantic 422s, 413 and 503
  are not in it.
* schema-cache requests are bounded and admitted like the others, on prefix plus suffix tokens, before any prefix is run on
  the GPU; a schema-cache request with no questions returns the empty answer set instead of an error.

Unchanged: the wire format of `/v1/systemone` and `/decide` (answers, `usage`, field order, 422 bodies), the schema cache and
its switches (`schema_first` in the config, `DECIDER_SCHEMA_CACHE`, `DECIDER_SCHEMAS`, `DECIDER_SCHEMA_MIN_SEEN`),
`DECIDER_MAX_BATCH`, `DECIDER_MAX_STATE_TOKENS`, `DECIDER_TEMPERATURE`. `DECIDER_BATCH_WAIT_MS` is the collection window as
before, default 0; `DECIDER_MAX_WAIT_MS`, declared but unused in 1.0.x, is now an alias for it. `DECIDER_MAX_FWD_TOKENS` is
replaced, not aliased, by `DECIDER_GRAPH_TOKEN_BUDGET` (32,768 padded tokens per forward). Start-up took 27 s (decider-2b) and
45 s (4B) for the graph grid on a B300.

Bench and test tooling: `decider/bench/replay_systemone.py` (replay a row file against a server, compare two runs),
`run_serving_matrix.py`, `verify_engine_v2.py`, `probe_cache_split.py`, `eager_reference.py`; `tests/test_serve_http.py` checks
the new server byte for byte against `serve_v1` on the same requests with a stand-in engine.

## 1.0.2 (2026-09-22): wrong answers from the cached shared-state path on Blackwell

Code only; no weights change. `decider.serve` scores the questions of one request against a cached prefix of the shared state
(`Engine.score_shared`), and the optional schema cache does the same for a cached schema. On a B300 with torch 2.14 / CUDA 13 the
cuDNN scaled-dot-product-attention backend that PyTorch selects for that masked rectangular attention (a suffix of a few hundred
tokens attending to a cached prefix of about 4,000) returns wrong, finite output in the first full-attention block; the math and
memory-efficient backends are correct, and the plain single-pass forward is unaffected. Effect: some long shared-state requests
got a wrong option with high confidence and the answer changed between identical requests. Reproduced on Decision Index row
RouterBench-5shot:26878 (prefix 4,006 tokens, suffixes 223 and 240): the cached path answered option_7 and option_10, the full
forward and the corrected path answer option_4 at p=0.95 and 0.93. Fix: `Engine` now disables the cuDNN SDPA backend before
compile and graph capture (`decider.engine.set_attention_backend_policy`). Found by an independent review of the serving path;
a review write-up with the reproduction commands is in the research notes. If you run the server from an earlier version on
Hopper or Blackwell, upgrade or set `torch.backends.cuda.enable_cudnn_sdp(False)` before constructing `Decider` or `Engine`.

## decider-35b-a3b v1 (2026-09-20): the supervised recipe on a 35B mixture-of-experts base

[Mapika/decider-35b-a3b](https://huggingface.co/Mapika/decider-35b-a3b) (bf16, 65 GB) and
[Mapika/decider-35b-a3b-nvfp4](https://huggingface.co/Mapika/decider-35b-a3b-nvfp4) (NVFP4 for vLLM and TensorRT-LLM, 19.6 GB).
One epoch of the public mixture on Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-Base with the routed experts frozen and Muon on the block matrices, 394
minutes on four B300s, no RL stage. Above decider-2b v10 on 93 of 95 regression tasks (in-task / held-out accuracy 0.855 / 0.810
against 0.805 / 0.755), +6.7 points on the validation rows, +5.0 on OpenJev, +6.9 on Mind2Web, JevBench hard tier 0.676 against
0.459, Bespoke's suite 0.774 against 0.704 macro. Greedy browser play 97.2% against 90.9%, sampled play 86.4% against 93.2%: the
argmax is right more often, the served distribution is less sharp, which is what the RL stage of v10 trains. The NVFP4 build
loses 1.0 to 1.5 accuracy points against bf16 in vLLM. Tables in the README ("Results"), training details and the AdamW
comparison in `HISTORY.md`, scripts in `moe/`.

## decider-2b v10 (2026-09-19): calibration-aware RL on live browser tasks and exact games

v10 is the v8 weights continued for 384 steps of reinforcement learning whose only rewards are outcomes: whether a browser task's
own checker reports success, whether a game is won, and how well the model's stated belief about the next outcome of an action
matches the exact probability law of the game. No gold labels enter. A hard KL limit to the v8 weights on replayed training rows
keeps the model's answers on its original tasks in place. The recipe, gates and every measurement are in [docs/RL.md](RL.md).

### Browser

![v8 (left) and v10 (right) solving live MiniWoB++ click tasks in Chrome; each frame shows the chosen element and its served probability](../media/v10_browser_montage.gif)

*v8 (left) and v10 (right) on eight live browser tasks, same pages and seeds. Each click is one typed decision: the clickable
elements on the page are the options, the model returns a probability for each, and the task's own checker grades the result.
Six of the eight tasks were never used for training. Per-task recordings: `media/v10_browser_*.gif`.*

The browser gain is in the served distribution: greedy play is 90.9% against 90.3%, sampled play is where the ten points are, and
the six tasks that were never rewarded gain the most.

### Games

![v8 (left) and v10 (right) on the same grid, tic-tac-toe, bag-draw and minesweeper boards, with the served action distribution written on every cell](../media/v10_games_montage.gif)

*Same boards, same dice for both versions. The numbers on the cells are the probabilities the model serves for each move; in
minesweeper the shading is the exact mine risk of each hidden cell, computed from all placements consistent with the revealed
numbers. Per-game recordings: `media/v10_game_*.gif`.*

A 2B model without search loses most of these games before and after RL. What moves is where the probability mass sits: in the
bag draws v10 puts 67% on the best bag where v8 spread 7% across many, and it wins 6 points more of them. On the grid, v10 puts 90%
on the right move where v8 put 37%, which helps when the move is right and hurts when the dice slip. Win rates on the same 234
boards, sampled play, with 95% intervals over boards:

| game | v8 | v10 | difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| bag draws (64 boards x 4) | 35.2% | 41.4% | +6.2 (+0.8 to +11.7) |
| 5x5 slippery grid (64 x 4) | 14.1% | 18.8% | +4.7 (−2.0 to +11.3) |
| tic-tac-toe against minimax with 25% random moves (74 x 4) | 23.6% | 23.0% | −0.7 (−4.7 to +3.0) |
| 4x4 minesweeper, 4 mines (32 x 4) | 2.3% | 0.0% | −2.3 (−4.7 to 0.0) |

### Calibration

![belief excess over the exact laws, and click-outcome prediction, v8 against v10](../media/v10_calibration.png)

Calibration is what the RL objective trains directly. For every action in a game with a known probability law, the model is
asked what will happen next, and its answer is scored against the exact law with a log score. v10 is 0.22 nats above the law
where v8 was 0.47. In the browser it predicts the outcome of its own click (success, failure, continue) at a log score of −0.03
against −0.35.

### Everything on the same rows

| on the same rows, v10 against v8 | v8 | v10 | difference (95% interval) |
|---|---|---|---|
| live MiniWoB++ click tasks, 22 tasks x 8 seeds, sampled play | 83.0% | 93.2% | +10.2 (+5.1 to +15.9) |
| the 6 tasks never used for reward | 72.9% | 91.7% | +18.8 (+6.2 to +31.2) |

What v10 does not change: general accuracy on its training tasks, calibration on Bespoke's suite, tic-tac-toe and minesweeper
play, and speed (same architecture, same readout, same temperature). The one measured regression is OpenJev, under one point.
v10 continues the v8 weights that were on the Hub; the v9 terse-bucket data described in the README is not in it.

## decider-2b v9: terse buckets and command safety

Teacher-written routing messages over plain option lists (`support`, `help`, `account`, no descriptions) and labelled shell
commands. Held-out terse-bucket routing, generic / specific / catch-all: 0.86 / 0.95 / 0.88 (v8: 0.59 / 0.96 / 0.93); the 94-task
set unchanged. v9 was described in the README but the Hub weights stayed v8, so v10 continues v8 and does not contain this data.

## decider-2b v8: isolated Score levels, generic options, second prompt layout

Every Score level judged in its own row with normalised fits; teacher-written custom questions with a generic option next to a
catch-all; the schema-first (cacheable) layout trained 50/50 with state-first. The weights are kept under the Hub tag `v8`.

## decider-2b v6 to v7: the input shapes Jev accepts

Described options, up to 255 options with one label token each, JSON states with path references, long inputs, and the
`POST /v1/systemone` request shape. Details in `HISTORY.md`, section "v6".

## decider-2b v5: the proper abstention fix

An abstain option is added to 10% of questions with three or more options; in a quarter of those the option list is replaced by
labels from an unrelated task so that the abstain option is correct.

## decider-2b v4: situation-to-action data and ten games

Next-action choice from agent trajectories and game states behind one typed interface (`decider/games/`), plus the Super Mario
Bros demo; the montage at the top of the README is this version.

## decider-2b v1 to v3: the one-pass readout

Cross-entropy on the letter logits at the answer slot over the public decision mixture, one temperature fitted on in-task
data. `HISTORY.md` has the per-stage numbers.
